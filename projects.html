                        <b>Rideshare Application</b> <br><br>
                        I along with a team of five other students designed a web application for the purpose of helping drivers and passengers coordinate
                        long-distance rideshare-style trips.<br><br> The application allows drivers the opportunity to post their rides to a consolidated database of
                        rides, which are displayed on a map. Drivers include information such as their planned departure time and destination, as well as any additional
                        details such as how much they are planning to charge. <br><br> Users searching for rides are able to access a map view of posted rides leaving from
                        their current location, and are provided filtering tools that allow them to find rides that most suit their needs.
